# projects

This is a repository of projects, ideas and interests over the years:
  - a cosmological modeling program written in C for solutions of the geometry of the Universe given the distribution of matter, dark matter, dark energy or various cosmic "fluids".
  - a photon path in a Schwarzschild black hole written in C.
  - a Java program to calculate the effects of time dilation on a cosmic journey.
  - a simple arcade-shooter written in Python.
  - a program to obtain historical stock data and calculate returns for model investment portfolios written in Python
  - a regularly tracked and updated spreadsheet of real Covid data for all LA County, with epidemiological models, in Excel.
  
... and whatever else that comes to mind!

Cheers.
